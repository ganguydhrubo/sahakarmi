# Changelog

All notable changes to Sahkarmi are documented here. The project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-10-20

### Fixed

- The provider chosen on the setup screen is now applied to the team: coworkers that have never
  run move to that provider's default model (for example "Free model (no login)" after choosing
  OpenCode), even when another AI such as Claude is also connected. Previously the team silently
  stayed on the first AI that happened to connect, which looked like the model was not saved.
- Fresh installs default to the bundled OpenCode instead of ChatGPT (Codex).
- Each AI provider's status is shown as soon as it is known instead of after all four were tried,
  so the model picker opens sooner.
- macOS release build no longer fails with "GitHub Personal Access Token is not set".
- The model picker in the message box opened downward, off the bottom of the window, so it
  looked dead. It now opens upward when there is no room below.
- Overlapping provider connections could leave a provider (typically OpenCode) stuck on
  "Checking" with every model greyed out; a resolved status is no longer overwritten.
- Free models that echo their tool call as text (`type=tool_call … <|func_arg_name|>`) no longer
  show that text in the chat.
- A second Sahkarmi instance exits immediately; the packaged-app launch checks allow 10 s.

### Added

- A plain-text log at `<app data>/logs/sahkarmi.log` (agent errors and provider status) for
  diagnosing problems on a user's machine. Settings → Export diagnostics still works.
- Weekly "Upstream watch" workflow: opens a pull request when a newer OpenCode is published,
  and keeps a tracking issue with the latest Claude Agent SDK, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI and upstream
  OpenBot releases (OpenBot code after v0.1.11 is noncommercial-licensed and is never merged).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-19

### Added

- Free AI out of the box: OpenCode 1.19.3 (MIT) is bundled inside the installer. Coworkers run on
  its free models with no login, account or API key.
- Gemini support through Gemini CLI (`gemini --acp`), using the user's existing Google sign-in
  (free tier), API key or Vertex AI. Models: Gemini Auto, Pro, Flash.
- Agent Client Protocol (ACP) adapter: any ACP agent CLI can drive a coworker, with Sahkarmi's
  browser, approval, take-over and team tools exposed through a loopback-only MCP bridge.
- Auto-detection of every installed AI CLI and its existing login: Claude Code, Codex (ChatGPT),
  Gemini CLI and OpenCode (including any provider signed in with `opencode auth login`).
- Coworkers that have never run move to whichever AI is actually available.

### Fixed

- Provider status rows no longer get overwritten when two connections overlap.
- Opening a coworker whose AI CLI is missing no longer shows an error.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-10-19

### Fixed

- Releases always publish the Windows installer, even if the optional macOS or Linux builds fail.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-19

### Fixed

- Release builds: macOS and Linux jobs no longer fail on timing-sensitive backend tests; first
  release with downloadable Windows, macOS and Linux installers.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-19

### Added

- Sahkarmi brand: logo, app icons, saffron/indigo palette (light + dark), bundled Mukta, Baloo 2 and
  Hind Siliguri fonts, English / हिन्दी / বাংলা interface.
- Three-pane coworker layout: workspace switcher, team list with live status, shared files,
  approvals inbox, settings.
- Five default coworkers: Asha (Accounts), Vikram (Sales), Meera (Support), Arjun (Research),
  Kavya (Content).
- Task queue strip with pause / resume / cancel, collapsible tool-call cards, voice input,
  run-on-schedule, and human browser take-over for login / 2FA / CAPTCHA.
- Approvals: coworkers must ask before payments, sending messages to customers, or submitting forms.

### Upstream

- Forked from OpenBot v0.1.11 (Apache-2.0). See NOTICE.
